# Deterministic-Finite-Automata
Deterministic Finite Automata for English Conjunctions/Adverbs/Adjectives

DFA is created to perform pattern matching on a large text to identify the pattern within the text by passing each character at a time from left to right to the DFA, simulating a finite state automaton. The language selected in this report is English Conjunctions/Adverbs/Adjectives.

The scope of the language in this report is only limited to only seven input strings or patterns, namely “and”, “most”, “good”, “bad”, “pretty”, “dirty”, and “blue”.
